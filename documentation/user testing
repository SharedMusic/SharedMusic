The user tests were very successful in providing feedback about our software. 

We interviewed several people. One of them was Mason, who is 19 years old and is working a full time job right now. He has no experience in computer science, design, or SoundCloud. 

When interviewing him, we first went through several important tasks for our software, and then asked him to just play around with the website and try new things. The first task was to create a room. He went through the expected motions of clicking the “Create a Room” button and entering his username. We then asked him to add more users to the room. He hesitated here, and didn't know how to go on. After giving him a hint though, he added another user. Mason said that he liked seeing exactly who was in the room, too. After that, we asked him to find two specific songs and add them to the queue. He did this quickly through the search interface. Adding a song to the queue was intuitive as well, and didn't cause any issues. 

When Mason was just exploring the app without guidance, he tried out a few of the other features, such as muting the music and adding songs through the discovery feature. He didn't seem to find it too difficult to navigate, though he did express wishes to be able to do some actions quicker than we allow. The major thing that he wanted to do was to leave this room and create a new one, with just one button.

The takeaway from this user test was that we need to make sharing rooms more clear. It's not always evident that the person needs to share the link to add others. Other than that, this user was able to navigate the website without too many issues. We learned that it was very useful to just have the user talk out loud about his experience with the website. It helped when Mason began talking out loud about what actions he was about to take. When he was doing this, it was also a lot easier to figure out if the action is intuitive, or if he is questioning that this is the right action to take.
